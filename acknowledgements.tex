First and foremost I'd like to thank Matthew Hole, my supervisor. I came 
into this year a little daunted at the prospect of tackling a physics-based 
project with a physics background not extending past ``A Brief History of Time''.
Your patience and willingness to explain concepts to me I'll forever appreciate, 
and your energetic approach to problem solving made me feel both at home and excited 
for the work we have done in this thesis. 

In a similar vein, thank you to the rest of the Plasma Theory and Modelling group for always being 
willing to answers questions when I had them. You guys were definitely my saving grace 
at times, and I only wish I spent more time getting to know you all. I should give 
a special shout out to Nick, Sandra, Dean and Josh specifically for being so 
accommodating, helpful, and kind in answering my questions when I would pop around.

I'd like to thank the other Honours students for helping make this a fantastic 
year. Our little nook of MSI proved very distracting, but in the best possible 
way. As such I would of course expect you to take part responsibility for the late night 
writing sessions at the end of the year - but you also get 
credit for making them enjoyable.

Last but certainly not least, to Kirsten and Graeme. Thank you for your support these last 
couple years, and the infinite kindness you give to all those around you. However silly it is, 
your encouragement genuinely helped motivate me at times, and I always got a bit of joy 
explaining my thesis and whatever problem I was working on at the time to you.
