% 2.1
\section{Magnetohydrodynamics}

Study of magnetism as a fluid. Physically everything is driven by 
particles and fields, however this is computationally infeasible. So MHD 
theory was developed, marrying fluid dynamics with Maxwell's equations

% 2.1.1.
\subsection{MHD Theory}

Lagrangian operator

Maxwell's equations

Assumptions and simplifications (leading into ideal MHD)

% 2.1.2.
\subsection{Ideal MHD}

Simplifications made to derive ideal MHD equations 

Use in GS equation 

Physical implications

% 2.2. 
\section{Grad-Shafranov Equation}

What is it

What do its components describe

Solutions to GS equation 

% 2.2.1
\subsection{Derivation}

Go through derivation of it 

% 3.1.
\section{AC Configuration Tokamaks}

Tokamak's normally in DC mode. What does it mean for a fusion reactor 
to operate in AC mode

% 3.1.1.
\subsection{Physical Differences}

Plasma current (talk: operation of toroidal coils to regulate current)



% 3.1.2.
\subsection{Why Bother?}

What benefits are there to using an AC design over DC?

Talk about confinement time, stability, etc
