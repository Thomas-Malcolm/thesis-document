\section{ISTTOK}

\red{Short chapter}

\red{Recall paper by Artur and Matthew}

% 5.1.1
\subsection{A Brief History of ISTTOK}

\red{Describe what ISTTOK is}

\red{Purposes of reactor? Maybe some of this isn't necessary / could be merged 
with the below section}


% 5.1.2
\subsection{Reactor Specification and Data}

\red{Brief reactor design (highlight configuration parameters, i.e. 
major/minor radius, regular magnetic field strength, etc)}

\red{Talk about the data we have, how it was derived, how reliable it is ($\pm 30\%$)}

\section{Parameter Fitting}

\subsection{Results}

\red{Showcase poor fitting at first}

\red{``coddle'' data into being better}

\red{Some time slices fit a bit better}

\red{Talk about why it doesn't fit very well - initial guess for $a_1, a_2$ and 
$\alpha$ very important due to poor parameter space}

\subsection{Further Work}

\red{Grid based approach for having a better initial parameter guess}

\red{Alternatives to $L_2$ optimisation, e.g. KKT}
